This was my first time working with front-end development. I wanted to use the [API](https://github.com/dom-ar/YouPoint-Youtube-AI-Summary-API) I created and make a front-end website for it. After running into roadblocks with developement and problems with my computer I basically did no work on it for months and decided to scrap it for a new project. The website can navigate trough pages, there is dark mode implementation using vanilla css to change tailwind colours by saving the theme in local storage. Components are using class-variance-authority.
